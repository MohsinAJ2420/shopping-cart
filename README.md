Shopping Cart Application This is a Shopping Cart application built using React, Context API, and useReducer. It simulates a shopping cart where products are generated using a fake API (@faker-js/faker), allowing users to view products and manage their shopping cart. The project demonstrates the usage of React state management tools like Context API and useReducer for managing global state across components.

Features Display a list of products with randomly generated data (using @faker-js/faker). Add or remove products from the shopping cart. Manage cart state using Context API and useReducer.
